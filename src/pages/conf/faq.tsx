        <p>
          The GraphQL Foundation and the Linux Foundation are dedicated to
          providing a harassment-free experience for participants at all of our
          events, whether they are held in person or virtually. GraphQLConf is a
          working conference intended for professional networking and
          collaboration within the open source community. It exists to encourage
          the open exchange of ideas and expression and requires an environment
          that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group. While at
          GraphQLConf or related ancillary or social events, any participants,
          including members, speakers, attendees, volunteers, sponsors,
          exhibitors, booth staff and anyone else, should not engage in
          harassment in any form.

          This Code of Conduct may be revised at any time by The GraphQL
          Foundation or The Linux Foundation and the terms are non-negotiable.

          virtually, indicates your agreement to abide by this policy and its
          terms.
